    I don't use this code for personal purposes, it's just a practical matter!!.

# Code description

This code is a C# demo application that illustrates basic operations with collections such as lists, dictionaries, queues, and stacks. The program is organized into several methods, each of which is responsible for performing certain tasks.:

   1. ExecuteListOperations: Performs operations with a list (List<int>), including adding, deleting, searching, and sorting items. The results are displayed on the console.

   2. ExecuteDictionaryOperations: Demonstrates working with a dictionary (Dictionary<string, int>), including adding, deleting, and displaying key-value pairs.

   3. ExecuteQueueAndStackOperations: Shows the usage of Queue (string) and stack (Stack<int>), including adding and removing items in the FIFO (first in, first out) and LIFO             (last in, first out) order accordingly.

   4. ExecuteCollectionInteraction: Demonstrates the interaction between different collections, including creating a dictionary to store name lengths, using a queue to store             names, and a stack to store name lengths.

Each method outputs the results of operations to the console, which allows the user to see how different data structures and their methods work.
